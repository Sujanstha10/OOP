creating thread using Runnable interface.

step 1: creating a class implementing Runnable interface
                class myThread implements Runnable{

                }
step 2: override run()method and add business logic to it.
                class myThread implements Runnable{
                    public void run(){

                    }
                }
step 3: create a instance of Thread class and pass the Runnable object to its constructor.
                myThread obj = new myThread();
                Thread t = new Thread(obj);
step 4: use of start() method.
                t.start();
